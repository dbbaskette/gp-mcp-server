# 📊 Spring AI MCP Security Compliance Report

**Date:** 2025-10-03
**Project:** Greenplum MCP Server
**Review Against:** [spring-ai-community/mcp-security](https://github.com/spring-ai-community/mcp-security)

---

## Executive Summary

Our implementation is **substantially compliant** with Spring AI Community MCP Security recommendations, with several **architecturally justified divergences** for our multi-tenant use case. We implement a **custom security solution** that exceeds the basic recommended pattern in functionality and security.

**Overall Compliance:** ✅ **Substantially Compliant with Justified Divergences**

---

## ✅ Compliant Areas

### 1. Core Security Principles ✅
- ✅ Uses Spring Security with `@EnableWebSecurity`
- ✅ Implements stateless API key authentication
- ✅ Stateless session management (`SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS`)
- ✅ CSRF disabled (appropriate for API key auth)
- ✅ Secure credential storage (AES-256-GCM encryption)
- ✅ Production-ready database storage (PostgreSQL, not in-memory)

### 2. API Key Format ✅
- ✅ Structured format: `gpmcp_{environment}_{token}`
- ✅ Cryptographically secure random generation using `SecureRandom`
- ✅ 32-character random tokens (Base64-encoded)
- ✅ ~192 bits of entropy per API key

### 3. Secure Storage ✅
- ✅ **Database-backed repository** using PostgreSQL via JDBC
- ✅ **NOT using in-memory storage** (avoids the bcrypt performance warning)
- ✅ Keys stored as **SHA-256 hashes**, not plaintext
- ✅ Additional encrypted data (GP credentials) using AES-256-GCM
- ✅ Automatic schema initialization and migration

### 4. Spring Security Integration ✅
- ✅ `SecurityFilterChain` bean configuration
- ✅ Custom authentication filter integrated into security chain
- ✅ Proper authorization rules (`.anyRequest().authenticated()`)
- ✅ Sets `SecurityContext` for authenticated requests

---

## ⚠️ Justified Divergences

### 1. Custom Filter vs `mcpServerApiKey()` Configurer ⚠️

**Recommended Pattern:**
```java
.with(mcpServerApiKey(), (apiKey) -> {
    apiKey.apiKeyRepository(apiKeyRepository());
})
```

**Our Implementation:**
```java
http.addFilterBefore(apiKeyAuthenticationFilter, UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class);
```

**Justification:**
- ✅ Requires **custom authentication logic** beyond simple validation
- ✅ API keys store **encrypted GP credentials** (username/password)
- ✅ Needs **multi-tenant connection pool management** per API key
- ✅ Custom filter provides full control over authentication flow
- ✅ Sets `SecurityContext` properly for Spring Security integration

**Verdict:** ✅ **Justified** - Our use case requires more than the standard pattern supports.

---

### 2. SHA-256 vs BCrypt Hashing ⚠️

**Recommended:** BCrypt (with warning: "computationally expensive, not suited for high-traffic production")

**Our Implementation:** SHA-256

**Comparative Analysis:**

| Aspect | BCrypt | SHA-256 (Our Choice) |
|--------|--------|---------------------|
| **Purpose** | Password hashing (adaptive cost) | API key hashing (fast lookup) |
| **Security** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (slow by design) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (cryptographically secure) |
| **Performance** | 🐌 100-300ms per check | ⚡ <1ms per check |
| **Use Case** | User passwords (low entropy) | API keys (192-bit entropy) |
| **Brute Force** | Resistant via slow hashing | Infeasible due to high entropy |

**Why SHA-256 is Appropriate:**

1. **High Entropy:** Our API keys have ~192 bits of entropy from `SecureRandom`
   - Not vulnerable to dictionary/brute-force attacks like passwords
   - BCrypt's adaptive cost provides no additional security

2. **Performance:** API authentication happens on every request
   - SHA-256: <1ms per validation
   - BCrypt: 100-300ms per validation (100-300x slower)
   - For high-traffic APIs, this difference is critical

3. **Security Model:** The security comes from the token's randomness, not slow hashing
   - 2^192 possible keys makes brute force infeasible
   - SHA-256 is cryptographically secure for collision resistance

4. **Recommendation Acknowledges This:** The docs warn that in-memory bcrypt is "not suited for high-traffic production" - we avoid this entirely

**Verdict:** ✅ **SHA-256 is more appropriate** for high-entropy API keys. BCrypt would waste CPU cycles with no security benefit.

---

### 3. Header Support: Multiple Headers ⚠️

**Recommended:** `X-API-Key` header

**Our Implementation:** Supports **both**:
- `Authorization: Bearer gpmcp_live_xxx` (primary)
- `X-API-Key: gpmcp_live_xxx` (fallback)

**Implementation:**
```java
// src/main/java/com/baskettecase/gpmcp/security/ApiKeyAuthenticationFilter.java
String authHeader = request.getHeader("Authorization");
String apiKey = extractApiKey(authHeader);  // Strips "Bearer " prefix

if (apiKey == null) {
    apiKey = request.getHeader("X-API-Key");  // Fallback
}
```

**Justification:**
- ✅ `Authorization: Bearer` is the standard OAuth/API authentication pattern
- ✅ `X-API-Key` follows MCP community convention
- ✅ Supporting both provides **maximum client compatibility**
- ✅ No security downside to supporting multiple headers

**Verdict:** ✅ **Enhancement** - More flexible than the recommendation.

---

### 4. Custom Repository Implementation ⚠️

**Recommended:** Implement `ApiKeyEntityRepository<ApiKeyEntityImpl>` interface

**Our Implementation:** Custom `ApiKeyRepository` using JDBC Template

**Feature Comparison:**

| Feature | Recommended Interface | Our Implementation |
|---------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Storage** | Interface-based (any backend) | JDBC Template (PostgreSQL) |
| **Schema** | Abstracted | Custom DDL with automatic migration |
| **Basic CRUD** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Encrypted credentials** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (AES-256-GCM) |
| **Expiration** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (`expiresAt` field) |
| **Active/inactive** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (`active` flag) |
| **Usage tracking** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (`lastUsedAt` field) |
| **Metadata** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (creator, description) |
| **Production ready** | ⚠️ Depends | ✅ PostgreSQL-backed |

**Justification:**
- ✅ More features than the minimal interface pattern
- ✅ Production database (PostgreSQL) not in-memory
- ✅ Schema migration for upgrades
- ✅ Type-safe JDBC with explicit SQL control

**Verdict:** ✅ **Enhancement** - Our repository is more feature-rich than the recommended minimal interface.

## 🔒 Security Enhancements Beyond Recommendations

Our implementation includes several security features **not mentioned** in the Spring AI MCP Security recommendations:

### 1. Encrypted Credential Storage 🆕
```java
// Each API key stores encrypted GP username/password
private String encryptedUsername;
private String encryptedPassword;
```
- Uses **AES-256-GCM** with authenticated encryption
- Encryption key from environment variable (`GP_MCP_ENCRYPTION_KEY`)
- Credentials never stored in plaintext

### 2. Multi-Tenant Isolation 🆕
- Per-API-key HikariCP connection pools with different GP users
- Leverages **Greenplum's native RBAC** for authorization
- True database-level multi-tenancy

### 3. API Key Lifecycle Management 🆕
- Optional expiration (`expiresAt` field)
- Active/inactive status (`active` field)
- Usage tracking (`lastUsedAt` field)
- Environment separation (`live` vs `test`)

### 4. Web UI for Key Management 🆕
- User-friendly interface at `/admin/api-keys`
- Connection testing before key generation
- Displays only masked keys for security (`gpmcp_live_a1b2***`)

### 5. Comprehensive Audit Logging 🆕
- Logs key generation, validation, and usage
- Security events (invalid attempts, etc.)
- Metadata tracking (creator, description, environment)

### 6. Schema Versioning 🆕
- Automatic schema migration on startup
- Safely drops old columns during refactoring
- Backward-compatible upgrades

## 🎯 Recommendations

### ✅ No Immediate Actions Required
Current implementation is secure, production-ready, and well-architected.

### 📅 Future Considerations

1. **Monitor Spring AI MCP Security Evolution**
   - If `mcpServerApiKey()` gains support for encrypted credentials
   - If the configurer supports custom authentication logic
   - Consider migrating if our requirements become standard features

2. **Add Rate Limiting** (not in recommendations, but important)
   ```java
   // Per-API-key rate limiting for DDoS protection
   @Bean
   public RateLimiter apiKeyRateLimiter() { ... }
   ```

3. **Enhance Key Rotation**
   - Currently: `active` flag and `expiresAt` field
   - Future: Automated rotation notifications
   - Future: Grace period for key transitions

4. **Separate Audit Log Table** (optional)
   - Currently: Logging to application logs
   - Future: Dedicated `api_key_audit_log` table
   - Benefit: Better forensics and compliance reporting

5. **HTTPS Enforcement** (production)
   - Add to deployment checklist
   - Use reverse proxy (nginx/haproxy) for TLS termination
   - Or Spring Boot embedded Tomcat with SSL
